In this scenario, at the end of compiling process, we have an executable standalone file which is well written for the OS, more secure, it's delivered in the machine binary language so more fast in term of running, but the flexibility to change is the bottleneck. Also, we have to wait until the end of compiling process to have a result, so it's not a fast-food approach.      INTERPRETED languages, in contrast, are executed line by line using an interpreter at the runtime session. As the result, they are more portable because we are not depended on the OS and platform. These languages are a good option in term of debugging and test because we can see the output right after a written piece of code.      The most famous example for compiled languages is C and his sibling C++ which are many boring stuff to handle before and at the time of compiling but after a successful compiling phase, the result is the most rapid program we could write.      An example of interpreted languages may be PYTHON, but it's not accurate because many modern languages don't use just the interpreted approach and usually they have a mixture approach between compiling and interpreting. But, JAVASCRIPT is a good and traditional example of Interpreted languages."
