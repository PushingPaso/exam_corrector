All errors are caught at compile-time before the execution. Compile Once, Run Many.      What is interpreted programming languages, it means by using an interpreter like Python & JavaScript, which code is translated and executed line-by-line at runtime. Usually it runs slower, as it translates while running. All errors will be found during execution, one line at a time. Interpret As You Go.

Instead, it relies on naming conventions and name mangling to indicate the intended visibility of attributes.      In Python, class attributes can be marked as private by prefixing their names with double underscores(__), which triggers name mangling. For example:      class MyClass:          def __init__(self):              self.__hidden = 60      This prevents direct access from outside the class (obj.__hidden raises an error), although the attribute can still be accessed using its mangled name (obj._MyClass__hidden).      This method does not enforce strict privacy but discourages external access and is in python's way that marking attributes as private."
